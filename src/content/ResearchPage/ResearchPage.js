            The huge brands of the world export their products to 190 countries. They now want 20-30% of recycled content material in their products. Additionally there is currently a 6m ton shortfall of recycled content annually. This research program addresses this circular economy with alternatives in the form of bio-based and biodegradable plastics material where feedstock is being produced from sustainable sources, eg, waste material such as a food fibre, vegetable fibre and algae.

            Consumers and companies are looking more for products that are sustainable using recycled, bio-based and biodegradable plastics polymer content. There’s a 70-90% saving in energy use on this bioplastic content portion mixed with virgin petroleum-based polymers, hence there’s a carbon reduction and a huge pollution abatement. Additionally this research program investigates the commercial responsibility of aligning manufacturing materials, processes and technology to customer demand for companies to be fit for purpose.

            This research program responds to consumers and companies in clarifying what is bio-based, biodegradable, and recycled plastics. This is the same for the recyclers clarifying what’s in their batches and the brands clarifying what’s in their feedstock. We aim to mitigate this ambiguity to achieve a consensual and fair definition of these complex materials using plain language and universal semiotics for non-specialised audiences.
